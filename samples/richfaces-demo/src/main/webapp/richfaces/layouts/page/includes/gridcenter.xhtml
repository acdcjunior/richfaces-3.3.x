				Layout is a wrapper component which should consist of layouts panels.  
				Every layout panel could be positioned inside the layout with corresponding 
				position attribute(<i>with top, bottom, left, right and center values</i>). 
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently for a horizontally aligned panels the "width" attribute 
				means a part of outer panel what that component takes. 
				This is a same semantic as HTML elements have - see&#160;  
				<h:outputLink style="color:#0078d0" value="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#type-multi-length" target="blank">HTML MultiLength</h:outputLink>
				In future we plan to expand the layouts with possibility of fixed and percents based width definitions.
