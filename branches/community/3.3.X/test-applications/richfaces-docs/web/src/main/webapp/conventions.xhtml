<h3>General</h3>

<ol>

<li>Make sure the code you committed is 100% valid and will not fail the deployment of the application.</li>
<li>Leave as many comments as possible. 
Do not assume that the code example is too obvious to be commented.
 Your comments can help other techwriters (or users) understand how your code functions. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Managed Beans and View Pages</h3>

<ol>
	<li>If you need just a single bean for your code sample you can place it in org.docs package.</li>
	<li>If your sample requires multiple beans make a separate package for the beans. For example, 
<i>org.docs.tree</i>  that houses <i>Tree.java</i> and <i>Nodes.java</i>.  This will keep the app clean and facilitate navigation.   
	
	</li>
	<li>Name view pages the same way as the component you are documenting. Example: <i>rich:colorPicker</i> is documented in <i>colorPicker.xhtml</i></li>
	<li>When a new view page is created do not forget to include it in the main menu.  Location: <i>webapp\layout\mainMenu.xthml</i></li>
</ol>
