If the number of elements in the list is greater than the number of columns specified in the "columns" attribute, the elements at the position in the list after the value of the "columns" attribute are ignored</description>

        <description> A comma-delimited list of CSS style classes that is applied to popup table rows. A space separated list of classes may also be specified for any individual row. The styles are applied, in turn, to each row in the table. For example, if the list has two elements, the first style class in the list is applied to the first row, the second to the second row, the first to the third row, the second to the fourth row, etc. In other words, we keep iterating through the list until we reach the end, and then we start at the beginning again</description>
